Enterprise customers must create an |IAM| Role that gives |CW| agent permission
to gather data from their |EC2| instance or production environment.

Use the following |language| code sample or the AWS Console to create an
|IAM| Policy and Role for an |CW| agent to access |CSM| in your environment.

Learn more about using |CSM| with |sdk| in :doc:`setup-metrics`.

.. For more information about |CSM|, see |CW_IAM_CSM| in the *|CWlong| User Guide*.
